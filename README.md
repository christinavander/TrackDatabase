The EOU track and field program will be hosting a track and field meet this spring. Teams will come
from all over Oregon, Washington, and Idaho to compete in the meet. Each team will bring at least one
athlete. Athletes will compete in a number of events, and a mark or result will be entered for each
athlete that competes in an event.
This assignment creates a database application to be used at this track meet and a Java program that can be used to access this database.
